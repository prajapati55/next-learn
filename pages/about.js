                    The idea of a free media is one that we at NewAgeIslam.com hold in the
                    highest regard. We believe in bringing our site visitors, readers and
                    audio listeners or video viewers the widest possible array of
                    information that comes to our notice in regard to the trials and
                    tribulations of the Muslim community all over the world in their bid
                    to adapt to the fast-changing circumstances of the Twenty-first
                    century and anything else that we deem my be of interest to or
                    necessary for our readers and viewers. We trust our worldwide
                    readership and audience, and believe them to be fully-capable of
                    making their own decisions and discerning their own realities,
                    regardless of our editors’ or contributors’ interventions on one side
                    of a certain argument or the other. We want Muslims to recognise while
                    holding any discussion that two-thirds of humanity, at lest, does not
                    agree with us, in fact most Muslims themselves hold very different
                    opinions from other Muslims and subscribe to different schools of
                    thoughts in interpreting their scriptures and in their responses to
                    current word events. Clearly there is no point in considering one’s
                    own view as final and applicable to the entire Muslim community, even
                    to one’s own sect or sub-sect, or more vainly, all humanity.

                    Is there something we can do about it? Perhaps, not much! It is too
                    gigantic a task for us to undertake with our meagre resources. But do
                    we have the option to do nothing, just stand and stare? We dont think
                    so. There is a large body of Muslims all over the world that we know
                    feels more or less the same way as we do. The internet gives us a
                    facility: we can try and bring many such people together either on one
                    platform or at least link many of the individual platforms of
                    like-minded people that already exist.

                <h3>
                    By establishing and running this website we aim at the following:
        </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Encourage serous rethinking about all Islamic postulates, point by
                        point, in the light of our requirements today in the 21st century.
                        Ijtihad is something we have ignored for centuries; obscurantist
                        sections of our society have sought to keep us mired in hoary
                        tradition and mere rituals. The task before us is, literally, to
                        create a New Age Islam.
          </li>
                    <li>
                        Keep the world Muslim community informed of all that is going on in
                        the Muslim world so that they can take informed decisions. Not every
                        body can keep track of all the events that impact us deeply as a
                        community or monitor the world media day after day. We will
                        endeavour to keep the community informed of the challenges facing us
                        in different parts of the world and how our co-religionists are
                        coping with them and if there is something we can contribute by way
                        of advice.
          </li>
                    <li>
                        Encourage a debate with our educated youth which seems to be going
                        astray and becoming a prey to misguided ideologies and participating
                        in activities that is endangering the lives of other Muslims and the
                        work entrusted to us, that of spreading enlightenment. We simply
                        cannot allow our own children to fall prey to these forces of
                        darkness and Jahiliya, who are endangering the community for their
                        own petty gains and for furthering their own political and other
                        objectives.
          </li>
                    <li>
                        Above all, to keep reminding ourselves of the rich spiritual
                        traditions of tolerance and pluralism and multi-culturalism that we
                        have inherited. It is indeed strange for any one who has inherited
                        the following thoughts and traditions to be considered a bigot. Let
                        me remind us of some of these right here.
          </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    All mankind is from Adam and Eve (Hawwa), an Arab has no superiority
                    over a non-Arab nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab; also
                    a white has no superiority over a black nor a black has any
                    superiority over a white - EXCEPT BY PIETY AND GOOD ACTION Do not
                    therefore do injustice to yourselves. Remember one day you will meet
                    Allah and answer your deeds. So beware: do not stray from the path of
                    righteousness after I am gone.

                <p>
                    Another great mystic Mansur al-Hallaj, famous for his formulation,
                    Anal Haq (I am The Truth: Aham Brahmo Asmi) wrote:
        </p>
                <p>
                    <i>
                        Like the herbage I have sprung up many a time On the banks of
                        flowing rivers. For a hundred thousand years I have lived and worked
                        In every sort of body."
          </i>
                </p>
                <h4>------Mansur al-Hallaj</h4>
                <p>And Read Rumi again:</p>
                <p>
                    There's a strange frenzy in my head, Of birds flying, Each particle
                    circulating on its own! Is the one I love everywhere? (The Essential
                    Rumi, p. 4)
        </p>
                <p>
                    Lo, I am with you always means when you look for God, God is in the
                    look of your eyes, in the thought of looking, nearer to you than
                    yourself, or things that have happened to you. There's no need to go
                    outside. Be melting snow. Wash yourself of yourself. (The Essential
                    Rumi, p. 13)
        </p>
                <p>
                    What do we mean by saying that God is not in heaven? We do not mean
                    that He is not in heaven, but that heaven cannot encompass Him. He
                    encompasses heaven. He has an ineffable connection with heaven just as
                    He has an ineffable connection with you. Everything is in His
                    omnipotent hands; everything is a manifestation of Him and subject to
                    His control. So, He is not outside the heavens and the universe but is
                    not totally inside them either, that is, they do not encompass Him but
                    He encompasses them totally. Someone asked where God was before the
                    earth, skies, and Divine Throne existed. We said that the question was
                    invalid from the outset because God is by definition that which has no
                    place.
        </p>
                <p>(Signs of the Unseen: The Discourses of Jalaluddin Rumi, p. 221)</p>
                <h4>-----Hazrat Jalaluddin Rumi</h4>
                <p>
                    Having inherited such grand thoughts and such broadmindedness, such
                    concern for pluralism and equality of mankind, all its races and
                    nationalities, Justice for all, concern for rights of not only all
                    humans but also animals and plants, it seems strange today for a
                    Muslim to be equated with the likes of Osama bin laden and Ayman
                    al-Zawahiri who do not mind destroying the image of Islam as a
                    religion of peace and submission to God and killing even Muslims, not
                    to speak of other innocent human beings for the sake of furthering
                    their own political ambitions and satisfying their own urges for
                    vengeance against the authorities that may have hurt them some time in
                    the past in some way. In todays world where misunderstandings about
                    Islam abound, we just have to try and bring the focus back on the
                    essential concepts in Islamic thought  peace, contempt for aggression,
                    submission to God and acceptance of all situations as having come from
                    God, prayer, mercy, forgiveness as a cure for all spiritual and
                    physical ills, reason, the spirit of inquiry, social justice and
                    individual responsibility.
