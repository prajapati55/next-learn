                <p>
                    The idea of a free media is one that we at NewAgeIslam.com hold in the
                    highest regard. We believe in bringing our site visitors, readers and
                    audio listeners or video viewers the widest possible array of
                    information that comes to our notice in regard to the trials and
                    tribulations of the Muslim community all over the world in their bid
                    to adapt to the fast-changing circumstances of the Twenty-first
                    century and anything else that we deem my be of interest to or
                    necessary for our readers and viewers. We trust our worldwide
                    readership and audience, and believe them to be fully-capable of
                    making their own decisions and discerning their own realities,
                    regardless of our editors’ or contributors’ interventions on one side
                    of a certain argument or the other. We want Muslims to recognise while
                    holding any discussion that two-thirds of humanity, at lest, does not
                    agree with us, in fact most Muslims themselves hold very different
                    opinions from other Muslims and subscribe to different schools of
                    thoughts in interpreting their scriptures and in their responses to
                    current word events. Clearly there is no point in considering one’s
                    own view as final and applicable to the entire Muslim community, even
                    to one’s own sect or sub-sect, or more vainly, all humanity.

                    Among the thousands of articles and comments posted here for your
                    consideration, or links and summaries of which are mailed to you
                    daily, there will doubtless be some that you find useless, and
                    possibly offensive, in content or in language; but we believe you will
                    be discerning enough to realize that even the ideas, subjects and
                    comments you disagree with have some value in terms of clarifying and
                    giving a context to your own ideas and endorsing our common agenda of
                    promoting a peaceful and prosperous life for all on the planet.
                    Offensive, particularly obscene language we keep removing from the
                    site whenever we observe them or some reader points out to us, but
                    this cannot always be done in good time as this is a non-monitored
                    site in the interest of facilitating readers’ comments.
        </p>

                <p>
                    The subjects we choose to discuss or the points of view expressed by
                    our writers, or even the editorial staff does not necessarily reflect
                    any official position of the website NewAgeIslam.com. It would be best
                    if our readers and viewers did not make any 'assumptions' about
                    NewAgeIslam.com on that count. This website is not about promoting any
                    agenda, even if its editors and contributors appear to have definite
                    opinions of their own on certain issues of concern to the ummah and
                    may even seek to convince others of the same. As we say in our
                    masthead we are here to help the Muslim community map out an agenda
                    suitable for the Twenty-First century through open, no-holds-barred
                    debates and discussions on all issues of concern. No community or sect
                    or individual of any persuasion is barred from participating in the
                    discussions on NewAgeIslam.com. We welcome all with open minds and
                    hope that some good will come out through this interaction.
        </p>

                <p>
                    It is our firm belief that it would be ill-advised and cowardly to
                    sweep under the carpet doubts and questions abut our own ideological
                    positions or any novel or strong views on any subject. Muslims will
                    have to consider all sorts of opinions -- of not only Muslims of all
                    sects and persuasions, but also ex-Muslims and non-Muslims, as indeed
                    would-be Muslims – to be able to arrive at a conclusion as to what
                    suits us best in a certain situation.
        </p>

                <p>
                    The situation we live in today in this New Age is vastly different
                    from the conditions that prevailed in 7th century Arabia at the time
                    of the advent of Islam. That is why Allah ("Subhanahu Wa T'ala" – SWT
                    – meaning "The Glorious and High") and Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him -
                    PBUH) in his wisdom gave us the instrumentality of Ijtihad, so that we
                    can continue to renew our religion as and when required. And it is
                    largely because we failed to use this instrument continuously through
                    the last one and a half millennium that we are in the mess we are in
                    today. We would have continued to be the most advanced community in
                    the world armed with the latest ideology, had we continued to heed
                    Allah (SWT) and Rasoolullah (PBUH) who had told us that we will need
                    to continuously renew our religion to stay ahead of the changing
                    times. In some respects we are still ahead of other religious
                    communities as a forward-looking community on the strength of the fact
                    that ours is the latest of revealed religions, but in many other
                    respects we lag far behind others who hold ideologies and ways of life
                    (deens) even older than our own. It is to their credit that despite a
                    lack of specific guidance in their theologies about a continuous
                    renewal of faith, they felt the need for doing so and have gone ahead,
                    while it is to our eternal shame that despite our original ideology
                    specifically asking us to continue to change with times, we have not
                    done so and are hence one of the most backward in our political,
                    societal and civilisational mores.

                    Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use
                    of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or
                    phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for
                    purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching
                    (including multiple copies for classNameroom use), scholarship, or
                    research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether
                    the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the
                    factors to be considered shall include - (1) the purpose and character
                    of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is
                    for non-profit educational purposes; (2) the nature of the copyrighted
                    work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in
                    relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the
                    use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
                    The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of
                    fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above
                    factors.

                <p>October 30, 1998</p>

                <p>
                    This memorandum provides a general description of the applicability of
                    the copyright law and the so-called "fair use" exemptions to the
                    copyright law's general prohibition on copying. It also describes
                    "safe harbour" guidelines applicable to classNameroom copying.
        </p>

                <p>
                    The federal copyright statute governs the reproduction of works of
                    authorship. In general, works governed by copyright law include such
                    traditional works of authorship as books, photographs, music, drama,
                    video and sculpture, and also software, multimedia, and databases.
                    Copyrighted works are protected regardless of the medium in which they
                    are created or reproduced; thus, copyright extends to digital works
                    and works transformed into a digital format. Copyrighted works are not
                    limited to those that bear a copyright notice. As a result of changes
                    in copyright law, works published since March 1, 1989 need not bear a
                    copyright notice to be protected under the statute.
        </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Two provisions of the copyright statute are of particular importance
                        to teachers and researchers:
          </strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    * a provision that codifies the doctrine of "fair use," under which
                    limited copying of copyrighted works without the permission of the
                    owner is allowed for certain teaching and research purposes; and
        </p>

                <p>
                    * a provision that establishes special limitations and exemptions for
                    the reproduction of copyrighted works by libraries and archives.
        </p>
                <p>
                    The concept of fair use is necessarily somewhat vague when discussed
                    in the abstract. Its application depends critically on the particular
                    facts of the individual situation. Neither the case law nor the
                    statutory law provides bright lines concerning which uses are fair and
                    which are not. However, you may find it helpful to refer to certain
                    third party source materials. Guidelines for classNameroom copying by
                    not-for-profit educational institutions have been prepared by a group
                    consisting of the Authors League of America, the Association of
                    American Publishers, and an ad hoc committee of educational
                    institutions and organizations. In addition, fair use guidelines for
                    educational multimedia have been prepared by a group coordinated by
                    the consortium of College and University Multimedia Centres (CCUMC).
                    These guidelines describe safe harbour conditions, but do not purport
                    to define the full extent of "fair use."
        </p>

                <p>
                    The guidelines, as well as other source material, are available
                    through a variety of resources, including through the world wide web
                    site https://fairuse.stanford.edu. Stanford University Libraries &
                    Academic Information Resources, in collaboration with the Council on
                    Library Resources and FindLaw Internet Legal Resources, are sponsors
                    of this web site. The site assembles a wide range of materials related
                    to the use of copyrighted material by individuals, libraries, and
                    educational institutions.
        </p>

                <p>
                    I hope that the discussion below helps to clarify further the nature
                    of "fair use."
        </p>

                <h3>I. Fair Use for Teaching and Research</h3>

                <p>
                    The "fair use" doctrine allows limited reproduction of copyrighted
                    works for educational and research purposes. The relevant portion of
                    the copyright statue provides that the "fair use" of a copyrighted
                    work, including reproduction "for purposes such as criticism, news
                    reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classNameroom use),
                    scholarship, or research" is not an infringement of copyright. The law
                    lists the following factors as the ones to be evaluated in determining
                    whether a particular use of a copyrighted work is a permitted "fair
                    use," rather than an infringement of the copyright:
        </p>
                <p>
                    * the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is
                    of a commercial nature or is for nonprofits educational purposes;
        </p>

                <p>* the nature of the copyrighted work;</p>

                <p>
                    * the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the
                    copyrighted work as a whole, and
        </p>

                <p>
                    * the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the
                    copyrighted work.
        </p>

                <p>
                    Although all of these factors will be considered, the last factor is
                    the most important in determining whether a particular use is "fair."
                    Where a work is available for purchase or license from the copyright
                    owner in the medium or format desired, copying of all or a significant
                    portion of the work in lieu of purchasing or licensing a sufficient
                    number of "authorized" copies would be presumptively unfair. Where
                    only a small portion of a work is to be copied and the work would not
                    be used if purchase or licensing of a sufficient number of authorized
                    copies were required, the intended use is more likely to be found to
                    be fair.
        </p>

                <p>
                    A federal appeals court recently decided an important copyright fair
                    use case involving course packs. In Princeton University Press, et.al.
                    v. Michigan Document Services, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth
                    Circuit concluded that the copying of excerpts from books and other
                    publications by a commercial copy service without the payment of fees
                    to the copyright holders to create course packs for university
                    students was not fair use. The size of the offending excerpts varied
                    from 30 percent to as little as 5 percent of the original
                    publications. Although the opinion in this case is not binding in
                    California, it is consistent with prior cases from other courts, and
                    there is a reasonable likelihood that the California federal courts
                    would reach a similar conclusion on similar facts.
        </p>

                <p>
                    Where questions arise, we suggest that you consult the guidelines for
                    classNameroom copying and other available source material available on
                    the fair use web site, cited above. Please note that the guidelines
                    are intended to state the minimum, not the maximum, extent of the fair
                    use doctrine. Thus, just because your use is not within the
                    guidelines, it is it not necessarily outside the scope of fair use. In
                    the absence of a definitive conclusion, however, if the proposed use
                    deviates from the guidelines, you should consider obtaining permission
                    to use the work from the copyright owner. In instances where the fair
                    use question is important and permission would be difficult or
                    expensive to obtain, a member of the Fair Use Advisory Group
                    (described below) or the Legal Office can assist in analyzing whether
                    a particular proposed use would constitute "fair use."
        </p>

                <p>
                    Some photocopying services will obtain copyright permission and add
                    the price of the royalties, if any, to the price of the materials. A
                    request to copy a copyrighted work should generally be sent to the
                    permission department of the publisher of the work. Permission
                    requests should contain the following:
        </p>

                <p>* Title, author, and/or editor, and edition</p>

                <p>* Exact material to be used, giving page numbers or chapters</p>

                <p>* Number of copies to be made</p>

                <p>* Use to be made of the copied materials</p>

                <p>* Form of distribution (classNameroom, newsletter, etc.)</p>

                <p>* Whether the material is to be sold</p>

                <p>
                    Draft form letters can be obtained from or reviewed by a member of the
                    Fair Use Advisory Group or the Legal Office.
        </p>

                <p>
                    For certain works, permission may also be sought from the Copyright
                    Clearance Centre (CCC) which will quote a charge for works for which
                    they are able to give permission. The Copyright Clearance Centre can
                    be contacted at www.copyright.com or (978) 750-8400, but it may be
                    easier to go through a copying service that deals regularly with the
                    CCC.
        </p>

                <h3>II. Course Reserves</h3>
                <p>
                    Some libraries at Stanford will refuse to accept multiple photocopies
                    or to make photocopies of copyrighted materials needed for course
                    reserves without first having permission from the copyright holder.
                    Other libraries on campus will accept a limited number of photocopies
                    for course reserves. Consult individual libraries for clarification of
                    their policies.
        </p>

                <p>
                    While the libraries have blanket permission from dozens of journals,
                    obtaining permission sometimes takes a good deal of time. Experience
                    in obtaining permission has shown that an inquiry addressed to a
                    journal publisher frequently produces information that the copyright
                    is actually held by the author, and four weeks is often inadequate to
                    obtain such permission. Four to six weeks is considered the norm.
        </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Permission may be obtained in a number of ways:</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    * Upon request, some libraries on campus will obtain materials for
                    course reserve. In these cases, the librarian will write to obtain
                    permission to photocopy or to purchase reprints. However, most
                    libraries do not provide this service.
        </p>

                <p>* Written permission may be obtained by the academic department.</p>

                <p>
                    * Oral permission may be obtained by faculty members, departmental
                    secretaries, or library staff, in which case a written record is
                    needed of that action.
        </p>

                <p>
                    Note that filling course reserve requirements may require two to three
                    months before the quarter begins if the library does not already have
                    a copy of the publication, if the publication is out of print, or if
                    the copyright holder is not readily available.
